# mini-centrifuge
This written 'bitacle' will show the main aspects of our Biophysics II (class 2023) final project. 
We are two Biology students from Buenos Aires, Argentina, attending to Universidad Nacional de LujÃ¡n (UNLu) planning to build from zero a 3D model mini centrifuge machine. 

We'll be using a hard drive disk, some 3D printed parts (rotor, machine's lid, etc.) and some other simple parts, that we plan to buy. 

This following work plan goes around the idea of trying to minimize the budget as much as posible, not only because we do not count with enough money to build this from scratch, but also we study Biology not Engineering. Moreover, we aim to tell all the curious people out there, that are lucky enough to find us surfing the internet, how this first experience worked for us at the very end of the first semester of the current year (our first four-month period in Argentina).

The main and secondary objectives of our project are:

~ Build a fully functional spin-down mini centrifuge machine
 
 . Data visualisation (rpm and time)
 
 . Speed regulation of the mini centrifuge machine

Last but not least, concepts such as:
- Newton's Laws
- Faraday-Lenz Law
- Electrical transformers principle
- Torque, angular momentum and angular velocity

Will be implicitly used in this project.

Welcome to our first science project!

## Work Plan

#### 09/06/2023
- HDD testing --> We need to know if one of our hard drive disks works without any mechanical problems, e.g.: check if the spinning platter rotates correctly
- 1st Stage of 3D model construction --> Try to assemble the rotor with our HDD.

#### 14/06/2023
- 3D carry disk and centrifuge's cover modeling and printing.

#### 16/06/2023
- Debate about making a brakes system and putting an on/off button.
- Design details and try to make the final assembling 

#### 21/06/2023
- Final tryout and exposition

## Bitacle

#### 07/06/2023
Concept review --> We carried out a work plan --> We analyzed some open-source options in Internet for our spin-down centrifuge model.

#### 09/06/2023
We were able to find two hard drive disks to use as our "engine" to provide the necessary energy to make our centrifuge spin in a way it could reach 5000 RPM. We disassemble both of them and removed the "disks" to be able to put the 3D rotor provided by our Professors. Then, we tested them to check if they working properly to accomplish one of our main goals in this project. 
We tried one of them by plugging in an usb adapter cable into our computer, but it didn't work at all. With less options availables in the Physics Laboratory, we tried to make the other one spin by connecting it with a battery, but the voltage was too high and we burned it by accident.
At the end of the day, we looked forward to other possibilities as a plan B, in case we didn't find a new HDD, such as using a PC processor cooler as a rotor.

#### 14/06/2023
We tested at our homes the HDD that was not working before and we were able to make it spin. Later that afternoon, one of our professors told us that he found another hard drive disk at his home and he was able to make it work without any problem at all, so he handed it over to us in case we burned the inner circuits down of the remaining disk. 
We brought a pc power supply to use as an energy source for the HDD and tested it on both of them to check if they worked correctly. 
Then, we printed a centrifuge rotor made especially for one of our disks (we found the model in thingiverse.com), but we couldn't make it fit with any of the available disks. On one hand, one of them had its holes too small, in a way we couldn't make them coincide with the ones of the rotor. On the other hand, the remaining disk had its surface slightly different compared to the ones in the market, it had kind of a conic area where we were supposed to attach the rotor and this didn't work properly. Therefore, we decided to melt down the center of the 3D printed rotor in a way it could fit well enough to work as it should. (We were able to finally assemble the disk and the rotos using some liquid silicone).

#### 16/06/2023
We made printed a carry disk case to use as a "HDD holder" for our centrifuge, but the dimensions were not correct. We took some new measurements of the hard drive disk and proceeded to make from zero another carry model in tinkercad, in addition to this we added a cover design made from scratch too. We look forward to have the centrifuge ready by june 21st.
