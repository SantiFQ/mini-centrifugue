# mini-centrifuge
This written "bitacle" will show the main aspects of our Biophysics II (class 2023) final project. 
We are two Biology students from Buenos Aires, Argentina, attending to Universidad Nacional de LujÃ¡n (UNLu) planning to build from zero a 3D model mini centrifuge machine. 

We'll be using a hard drive disk, 3D printed parts (the rotor, machine's lid, etc.) and some other simple parts, that we plan to buy. 

This following work plan goes around the idea of trying to minimize the budget as much as posible, not only because we do not count with enough money to build this from scratch, but also we study Biology not Engineering. Moreover, we aim to tell all the curious people out there, that are lucky enough to find us surfing the internet, how this first experience worked for us at the end of the first semester of the current year (our first four-month period in Argentina).

Last but not least, concepts such as:
- Newton's Laws
- Faraday-Lenz Law
- Electrical transformers principle
- Torque, angular momentum and angular velocity
Will be implicitly used in this project.

Welcome to our first science project!

## Work Plan

#### 09/06/2023
- HDD testing --> We need to know if one of our hard drive disks works without any mechanical problems, e.g.: check if the spinning platter rotates correctly
- 1st (First) Stage of 3D model construction --> Try to assemble the rotor with our HDD.

#### 14/06/2023
- Modelar e imprimir carry disk, tapa y pie de apoyo.

#### 16/06/2023
Ensamblaje.Analizar fuentes de alimentacion. Analizar sistemas de prendido y de freno.

#### 21/06/2023
Prueba final. Uso del arduino para analisis de velocidad.
